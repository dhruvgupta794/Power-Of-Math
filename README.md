This project tells how to design and build a simple web application from scratch. 
I picked five different servicesâ€”Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway and DynamoDB.
Then I build out each of the services, resulting in a fully-functional math web application called "Power of Math" which gives out exponential result of a number.
